FastBitmap - The Fast C# Bitmap Layer
=====================================

FastBitmap is a bitmap wrapper class that intends to provide fast bitmap read/write operations on top of a safe layer of abstraction.

It provides operations for setting/getting pixel colors, copying regions accross bitmaps, clearing whole bitmaps, and copying whole bitmaps.

This project contains the FastBitmap class and acompanying unit test suite.
